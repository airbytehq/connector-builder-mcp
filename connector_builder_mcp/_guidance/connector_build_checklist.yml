# Connector Builder Development Checklist
#
# This checklist guides you through the process of building a declarative
# (yaml) source connector using the Connector Builder MCP Server.
#
# Steps marked with "📝" have outputs which should be shared with your user,
# or in a log file if no user is available.

# Task lists matching TaskList model properties
basic_connector_tasks:
  - id: locate-api-docs
    name: Locate API documentation
    description: 📝 Locate API reference docs using online search.
  
  - id: identify-auth-methods
    name: Identify authentication methods
    description: >
      📝 Identify required authentication methods. If multiple auth methods
      are available, decide which to build first.
  
  - id: check-advanced-features
    name: Check advanced features
    description: >
      If the user or the API itself appear to require advanced features,
      check the docs tool to understand how those features might be
      implemented before you start.
  
  - id: enumerate-streams
    name: Enumerate streams
    description: >
      📝 **Enumerate all available streams first**: Before beginning work on
      any stream, research the API documentation to identify and list ALL
      available streams/endpoints. Share this complete list with your user
      (or the message thread) so they can provide guidance on priorities or
      exclusions.
  
  - id: request-dotenv-file
    name: Request .env file
    description: >
      If you do need secrets for authentication, and if user is able to
      create a .env file for you, ask them to provide you a path to the file.
  
  - id: populate-secrets
    name: Populate secrets
    description: >
      Use your tools to populate required variables to your dotenv file, then
      let the user enter them, then use your tools to verify they are set.
      (You will pass the dotenv file to other tools.)
  
  - id: secrets-security
    name: Follow secrets handling policy
    description: '**Important**: Secrets should not be sent directly to or through the LLM.'
  
  - id: confirm-stream-list
    name: Confirm stream list
    description: >
      📝 After enumerating streams, ask the user to confirm the list before
      you start. They can: (1) optionally suggest what the 'first stream'
      should be, or (2) inform you about specific streams they'd like you to
      ignore.
