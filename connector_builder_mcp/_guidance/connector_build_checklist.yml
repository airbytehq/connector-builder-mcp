# Connector Builder Development Checklist
#
# This checklist guides you through the process of building a declarative
# (yaml) source connector using the Connector Builder MCP Server.
#
# Steps marked with "📝" have outputs which should be shared with your user,
# or in a log file if no user is available.

# Task lists matching TaskList model properties
basic_connector_tasks:
  - id: locate-api-docs
    name: Locate API documentation
    description: 📝 Locate API reference docs using online search.

  - id: enumerate-available-streams
    name: Enumerate available streams
    description: >
      📝 **Enumerate all available streams first**: Before beginning work on
      any stream, research the API documentation to identify and list ALL
      available streams/endpoints. Share this complete list with your user
      (or the message thread) so they can provide guidance on priorities or
      exclusions.

  - id: identify-auth-requirements
    name: Identify authentication requirements
    description: >
      📝 Identify supported authentication methods. If multiple auth methods
      are available, decide which to build first.

  - id: understand-special-requirements
    name: Understand special requirements
    description: >
      If the user or the API itself appear to require advanced features,
      check the docs tool to understand how those features might be
      implemented before you start. Document special requirements in the
      'special requirements' tasks section.

  - id: confirm-secrets-and-connection-details
    name: Confirm secrets and connection details
    description: >
      If you need secrets and/or connection information, you will need to
      gather those from the user. This is a no-op if the user has already
      provided you a dotenv with all necessary values, or if the connector does
      not require secrets.

      Do not proceed until you have all necessary secrets and connection
      details.

      **Important**: Secrets should not be sent directly to or through the LLM.
